### Outbreak Zville v0.21 is up (FINAL) - No longer in development

Final version of outbreak-zville is simulation of zombie-virus spread in small isolated place.  
It's based on few factors like percentage chance to survive zombie-human encounter,  
speed of zombie, potential for resistance, zombie behaviour, virus latency.  
Default values predict that it takes around __one hour for zombies to wipe out a village__ of size 
200-2500.  
It seems, that there are also considerable chances it can be stopped.  
There is also more personal scope of zombie encounter. When virus reaches certain  
home, focus is changed to present family versus zombies battle.  
User can determine size and names for village and family or choose random.  
Simulation runs in command line interface, has basic ascii graphic and  
is written in procedural python with standard library (python3+ compatibility).
