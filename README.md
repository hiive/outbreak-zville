### Outbreak in Zville

####Realism focused simulation of zombie outbreak in small community.    


=================================================================================  
Outbreak in Zville in one sentence is: **"What will really happen if zombie  
 outbreak strike an isolated** village ?"    
 Are your village and your family prepared for zombie apocalipse ?   
Check your chances with random or custom conditions and  
watch as death unfolds and things get screwed. 

**Current release status v0.1**
(CommandLineInterface now but I plan on data visualisation at least in form of 
 statistical charts). In current stage of development, the simulation is just `attack of user 
 defined amount of zombies on user determined size of family and code is running to outcome at soon 
 user determined speed. `

**Big picture for future:**  
(just a rough sketch and vision. Don't hold me on my words later LOL) 

_Simulation of epidemy in contained area of small village. Virus turns humans into zombies that 
attack each other. 
Those event are watched from perspective of some family member as they unfold. 
Some interaction may be possible but primarily it is designed as simulation running to resolution 
under different predetermined conditions. User will define starting conditions and simulation will 
just run to its resolution by determined speed. This is going to be REALISTIC simulation so no game 
oriented rather watching HOW things die under isolated viral outbreak (military will isolate area 
waiting for approval to go nuke with it). This may be depressing that everybody gonna die but hey, 
what about dying as hero ? Though I do think of adding some experience where user can influence odds 
of one just person based on his experience with running simulation. 
Part of simulation will be abstract and part will be based on 
detailed AI decision making from perspective of one family. This 
is where the simulation go personal so I hope not boring. 
Depending on development progress abstract part will decrease and
"sophisticated" AI will be taking over simplifications. More 
factors and in more detailed manner will be considered to 
equations._
