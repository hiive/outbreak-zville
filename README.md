Is your family prepared for zombie apocalipse ? Check your chances.

OK. Big picture for future is...
Simulation of epidemy in contained area of small village. Virus turns humans into zombies that attack each other.
Those event are watched from perspective of some family member as they unfold. Some interaction may be possible but primarily
it is designed as simulation running to resolution under different predetermined conditions.
So user will define starting conditions and simulation will just run to its resolution by determined speed.

NOW, that simulation is just attack of user defined amount of zombies on user determined size of family and code is running
to outcome at soon user determined speed.
